    "abstract": "Abstract— Significant attention in the field of Electric Vehicle related to the development of alternative energy sources, the (EV) battery development has been directed towards enhancing depletion of fossil fuels, and the current atmosphere of the longevity of the batteries. EV batteries commonly experience uncertainty. The three primary directions of EV technology severe power ripples throughout the charging and power have been pure EVs, hybrid EVs, and fuel cell EVs. Batteries, conversion operations, which might cause battery deterioration, the vehicle's chemical energy storage medium, are critical to especially in low-temperature conditions. The term \"ripple\" these improvements. The growing popularity of EVs is due to generally refers to undesired variations in the AC voltage when attributes such as long battery life, rapid charging, and high applied to a DC power source. Ripple current is generated by power and energy density [2]. The battery system is critical motor drivers, power conversion elements, DC power outlets, for electric cars since the range is related to battery capacity. on-board chargers, and brake charging. This research As a result, batteries with greater energy capacity are in high addresses the essential need for predicting ripple current demand. Chargers that are compatible with the essential to maintain the quality and longevity of EV batteries. The study infrastructure have been produced as a result of technological used Deep Learning (DL) models, namely Convolutional Neural advancements.

Optimized battery monitoring algorithms are functioning range [4]. In addition to ensuring battery safety, a essential for ensuring the battery pack's overall life cycle. battery management system (BMS) has to evaluate the Because of its great efficiency with energy, low self-discharge battery's state to precisely estimate the possible energy supply rate, power-to-weight ratio, and low maintenance requirements, to the load. This is an extremely difficult task because the lithium-ion batteries are desirable. The right battery technology battery's useful capacity and internal resistance change over and efficient utilization are crucial. Cell balancing serves as a time. Batteries are monitored internally by Battery fundamental feature of battery management systems (BMS) in Management Systems (BMS), which compute various metrics electric vehicles (EVs), which assist in monitoring, controlling, such as State-of-Charge, State-of-Health, State-of-Power, and",

A centralized management system is The data collected by the central system are information required to manage several charging stations. The central on the availability of cs, meter status, and charging transaction system uses collected historical charging transaction data to data. Transaction data is crucial for EV managers to determine analyze patterns of EVCS energy consumption. A supervised the energy needs that cs consumes every day. Moreover, the machine learning model is applied to forecast the charging CS manager can also know when energy consumption reaches station (CS) energy consumption for the next day based on the its peak to make decisions. daily transaction of the previous days. Weather condition data Therefore, a framework is needed to predict CS energy are also applied as additional parameters to determine their consumption for the next day based on historical transaction effect on charging energy consumption. Four machine learning data from the previous few days. Data collected from each CS algorithms have been evaluated, including Random Forest (RF), must use a standardized communication protocol to facilitate Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost, and Multilayer integration with other CS networks or CS from different Perceptron (MLP).

In fact, many drivers struggle today. Predicting occupancy will also facilitate scheduling to locate a convenient charging station before their vehicle’s maintenance of charging points during periods of low usage battery runs out. This study introduces a novel approach to [3] and allows Charging Station Operators (CSOs) to manage addressing the issue of congestion at public charging stations the available grid resource better. and reducing the amount of time drivers spend waiting in line by predicting their occupancy.

As more battery systems methods wrong results. It is crucial to mitigate the advanced require network connectivity for intelligent health monitoring, cyberattacks in the battery health monitoring systems. cyberattacks become a serious threat. A notable attack is an adversarial attack that generates stealthier input data Currently, a common mitigation strategy for adversarial misleading the ML results. This paper introduces an adversarial attacks is adversarial training using generative adversarial attack targeting battery health monitoring system and explores networks (GANs) [4]. ML-based attack detection models are a quantum annealing (QA)-based machine learning method to trained using adversarial examples to classify the adversarial mitigate the adversarial attacks. In this paper, a Quantum Boost examples into the correct classification. However, adversarial (QBoost)-based state of health (SOH) estimation algorithm for training requires computational resources to generate electric vehicles is developed and trained by D-Wave QA processor and the performance is compared with a state-of the adversarial examples, increasing the cost of model usage. It art random forest (RF)-based SOH estimation method. The has been debated whether there is a type of ML model or any experimental results show that the proposed QBoost method is data processing technique that is most adept at defending more robust to the adversarial attack than the RF method, while against adversarial attacks [5].

The variation in the control and manage systems are based on the performance and features as well as the overall cost. HEVs were really high increased air and oil emissions control. HEVs of different designs are becoming increasingly common, as they can achieve high fuel savings and mitigate emissions through multiple storage systems. The most powerful approach is the battery-driven vehicles.This article examines the management of energy issue with the minimisation of the operating costs of the HEVs for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The energy management strategy and hybrid performance enhancement are the key to ensuring the system functions properly. The battery energy is managed using the proposed GA approach based on reinforcement learning (RL) which is originated from the ML. The results are obtained and verified successfully.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a demand response method to reduce the long-term charging cost of single plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) while overcoming obstacles such as the stochastic nature of the user's driving behaviour, traffic condition, energy usage, and energy price. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an unknown transition probability matrix and solved using deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed method does not require any initial data on the PEV driver's behaviour and shows improvement on learning speed when compared to a pure model-free reinforcement learning method. A combination of model- based and model-free learning methods called Dyna-Q reinforcement learning is utilized in our strategy. Every time a real experience is obtained, the model is updated, and the RL agent will learn from both the real experience and “imagined” experiences from the model. Due to the vast amount of state space, a table-lookup method is impractical, and a value approximation method using deep neural networks is employed for estimating the long-term expected reward of all state-action pairs. An average of historical price and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network are used to predict future price. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and its ability to reach an optimal policy quicker while avoiding state of charge (SOC) depletion during trips when compared to existing PEV charging schemes.",

Due to the and worse battery performance. Electric energy has given development of EVs and HEVs, battery technology has made efficiency and CO2-free operation to the Vehicle sectors, as tremendous progress in recent years. However, the estimate of the well as drastically reduced maintenance costs, thanks to state of charge (SOC) remains a battery engineering challenge. The technological advancements. Given the rising demand for remaining load ratio to the maximum load battery capacity is electrical equipment in automobiles, this move was defined as the SOC. In terms of battery safety and maintenance, the SOC estimate is of prime importance. Artificial intelligence, notably unavoidable [2]. In reality, the energy storage system of machine learning-based systems, has recently been used to estimate electric vehicles is the major difference between the twentieth battery state, both as part of adaptive systems and as stand-alone century and the present. Certainly, there has been tremendous systems. The use of data-driven algorithms to estimate battery progress in the other systems. However, in the electrification conditions with high precision is a potential approach. The purpose of mobility, battery systems are the most important aspect. of this study is to offer a novel and highly accurate approach for There are many different types of energy storage systems that predicting the state of charge (SOC) of a Li-ion battery cell that",

    "abstract": "Abstract We present our research in optimal power management for a generic vehicle power system that has multiple power sources using machine learning and fuzzy logic. A machine learning algorithm, LOPPS, has been developed to learn about optimal power source combinations with respect to minimum power loss for all possible load requests and various system power states. The results generated by the LOPPS are used to build a fuzzy power controller (FPC). FPC is integrated into a simulation program implemented by using a generic simulation software as indicated in reference [22] and is used to dynamically allocate optimal power sources during online drive. The simulation results generated by FPC show that the proposed machine learning algorithm combined with fuzzy logic is a promising technology for vehicle power management.",

To control interconnected informatively and controlled intelligently. In such a highly complex system, autonomous algorithms and particular, if 100% of the electrical power is to be generated artificial intelligence (AI) are needed. One possibility for such a from RES, local flexibility within the grid has to be effectively system is presented in this paper using reinforcement learning utilized in a decentralized manner. with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) as a multi-agent approach. The DQN agents were trained in a simulated LV grid environment One way to realize such intelligent and autonomous control with pseudo-measurement data of household loads, EV charging, is the use of reinforcement learning (RL) systems. RL systems and photovoltaics (PV) power generation profiles. The objective offer the advantage of being able to control dynamic systems of the DQN agents is to increase the proportion of PV power and adapt to all types of states of these dynamic systems.

Additionally, a large number of EVs are connected to the grid within a uncertainties such as vehicle arrival and departure times, power short period.

Due to the rapid increase in which inject harmonics in the grid. In-fact semi-conductor Electric Vehicles, the number of Electric Vehicle Charging devices have non-linear V-I characteristics. Although, EVs stations has increased, leading to a poor voltage profile on the operate on battery which has the capacity (kWh). To recharge distribution grid. Since the presence of power semiconductor the battery, the EV must be connected to EVCS. Here, the devices and components inside the electric vehicle charging converter is used to convert the available AC supply to DC, and modules led to predominant power quality disturbance, which led with the help of a buck converter, further, it is scaled down to a to the system's additional loss and maloperation of equipment, to resolve this issue, with the help of voltage and current signals as particular voltage level for the battery. So, these converters the input data, the power quality disturbances are classified using adversely affect the grid, which is discussed in detail in the Machine Learning algorithms. In this work, different machine upcoming section. The Level 1 and Level 2 charging equipment learning classification models have been used, and their have converters along with the battery pack, whereas Level 3 performances are discussed. From the simulation validation, the has converters as a part of the charging station infrastructure. model that best performs for classification is the Cubic Support These power electronic-based components consume non-linear Vector Machine, with an accuracy score of 99.6%.

    "abstract": "With increasing global demand for green transportation, the urge to innovate and implement electric vehicles (EVs) has also picked up steam. Behind the performance, safety, and reliability of EV stands the Battery Management System (BMS) that optimizes battery performance through monitoring, management, and protection of the battery pack. Traditional BMS designs have rule-based or model-based approaches with static parameters, which are not sufficiently adaptive to deal with real usage patterns and battery aging effects. The presented paper proposes a scheme of adaptive control based on AI for BMS utilizing the ML and DL algorithms to enhance system robustness, extend the life of the battery, and optimize charging/discharge operations. The proposed system utilizes neural networks and reinforcement algorithms to estimate dynamic state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), and temperature control against varying loads and ambient conditions. We compare the operation of our framework with traditional BMS controllers through HIL tests and simulation. Our findings indicate that AI-based BMS delivers more accurate predictions, fault tolerance, better energy efficiency and battery life improvements. This paper presents a critical survey of common AI use cases employed in BMS, proposes a novel hybrid AI architecture for adaptive real- time control, and proposes deployment strategies that can be deployed on the latest EV platforms. Future work opportunities involve integrating edge-AI for real-time inferencing and federated learning for privacy-respecting data analysis in distributed EV fleets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract— Qualification testing of Li-ion batteries usually involves caused by various failure mechanisms including solid electrolyte battery capacity fade trend monitoring over a large number of interphase (SEI) layer formation and growth, electrode particle repeated charge/discharge cycles. However, due to cracking, electrolyte decomposition, and lithium deposition [1- manufacturing-induced variations, capacity fade trends of 4]. One of the most prominent mechanisms is SEI layer batteries from the same as well different production lots can differ formation and growth. The SEI layer consists of organic and from each other. This paper discusses a real-world problem where inorganic products that form on the negative electrode surface the Li-ion batteries from a particular production lot exhibit a due to the reaction of lithiated graphite negative electrode with different capacity fade trend than that exhibited by healthy the electrolyte [5]. A stable SEI layer is self-limiting and protects batteries from earlier production lots. The paper also outlines the the electrode from further reaction and hence is required for approach to identify these anomalous batteries at the earliest stage longer cycle life. However, in reality, the SEI layer cracks due of testing and provides a case study that applies one-class support to Li intercalation-induced volume changes in the negative vector machine (SVM) based methods to detect the anomalous electrode and thus provides new sites for the reaction between capacity fade behavior. electrode and electrolyte [3]. The SEI layer consumes active lithium, a measure of battery capacity, and hence reduces",

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular all over the world in recent years. Many countries have been offering reward policies and facilitating the establishment of EV charging stations and battery exchange stations to encou- rageuseofthesevehiclesbythepublic.However,intermsof electricity demand, the rapid establishment of EV charging stationsandbatteryexchangestationsmayleadtosignificant increases in peak loads, the contracted capacities, and basic electricity charges. In this work,an intelligent EV energy man- agement mechanism is proposed to make use of scheduling systems for the charging stations in order to determine when tostoreelectricityinbatteriesaccordingtothereal-timeelec- tricity price and the recharging requirements of EVs. Meanwhile, a recharging suggestion module is presented in this work for locating the most suitable charging station or battery exchange station for an EV according to the available information on hand. When an EV cannot reach any charging stationbecauseitisrunningoutofelectricpower,amobileCV managementmoduleisusedtoassisttheEVtofindasuitable mobile CV for recharging. Notably, a well-known machine learning technique, multiobjective particle swarm optimiza- tion, was employed in this work to assist in solving the multi- objective optimization problems during the design of an energy management mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can balance the loading ofbatterychargingandexchangestations,andlowertheload peaktokeepelectricitycostdown.Meanwhile,therecharging suggestion module can decrease the driving distance of EVs for finding the charging stations, as well as decreasing the waiting time wasted while charging. The mobile CV manage- ment module, for its part, can effectively prevent EVs from becoming stranded on the road because they have run out ofelectricity.

In most current works, EV charging is taken as an Existing methods based on solving optimization problems place a high demand on the accuracy of a given battery model, which is optimization problem with the implicit assumption that the difficult to acquire due to the limited types of battery models and change in state of charge (SOC) is linear with constant charging parametric uncertainties. Therefore, it is necessary to discover a power across the overall time horizon or within many novel way to address this problem without a precise mathematical discretized time intervals. For example, the smart charging battery model. Therefore, we propose a charging control method strategy proposed in [5] works well for an EV aggregator in a based on reinforcement learning (RL) to seek an optimal charging large-scale system, with consideration of the constant charging portfolio to minimize charging costs, which can be battery model efficiency for different levels of charging power.

    "abstract": "Abstract—In electric vehicle (EV) systems, diagnosing battery states, such as state of health (SOH), is crucial to guarantee safety. Such a diagnosis can be used to deter- mine the replacement time for a battery or to assess the drivingmileage.Themajorityofstudiesinrecentdecades have defined SOH under fairly constrained assumptions, such as cycling within a fixed range and in fixed tempera- ture. Unfortunately, the assumptions cannot be applied to real-life EV batteries, which for the most part are cycled arbitrarily. In clear contrast, this paper studies how SOH canbeestimatedinmorepracticalenvironments,inwhich batteries must support real-world driving patterns. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to trace SOH us- ing measurable EV data, such as current (I) and voltage (V). While the existing data-driven approaches are mostly Fig.1.

    "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges faced by Electric Vehicle (EV) manufactures is insufficient charging stations. Estimating the aging of the battery in the electric vehicle helps the driver to predict the driving range of the vehicle. This paper proposes a battery management system that is developed to predict remaining battery charge of the Electric Vehicle. The aging of the lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery present in the electric vehicle is predicted using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The parameters such as voltage, current and temperature are taken from the sensors connected to the LPC2148 ARM board and the values are given as dataset to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithms. The experimental results indicate that for real-time data Naïve Bayes algorithm gave the best results in terms of metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score. Naïve Bayes produced results with the accuracy rate of 88% and used to calculate the Remaining Battery Capacity which helps predicting the aging of the lithium- ion battery.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the broad use of carbon electrodes for electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) because of large surface area, high porosity and low cost. Whereas experimental investigations are mostly focused on the device performance, computational studies have been rarely concerned with electrochemical properties at conditions remote from equilibrium, limiting their direct applications to materials design. Through a comprehensive analysis of extensive experimental data with various machine-learning methods, we report herein quantitative correlations between the structural features of carbon electrodes and the in-operando behavior of EDLCs including energy and power density. Machine learning allows us to identify important characteristics of activated carbons useful to optimize their efficiency in energy storage. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

    "abstract": "Abstract—Multiunit residential building (MURB) residents are an upcoming segment of electric vehicle (EV) owners and potential buyers (around 42% in Europe). Garage-orphaned MURB residents have to mostly rely on public chargers, which currently handle only 5% of the EV charging needs. With EVs becoming more mainstream, public chargers will not be able to match the operations scale without additional deployments. This will not only lead to a demand–supply mismatch in the short term but also impact the growth of EV adoption in the long term. For man- aging the demand–supply mismatch, dynamic pricing is a widely used control tool, but it is often difficult to make in- formed pricing decisions when 1) there is variability (both) in demand and supply, 2) users’ spatiotemporal behavior and price elasticity are unknown, and 3) charging preconditions (such as the state of charge) are not freely available. In this article, we present SurCharge, which uses reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these challenges in dy- namic pricing for EV charging. Our approach is evaluated on real-world traffic patterns for Luxembourg by augment- ing the Luxembourg Simulation of Urban Mobility traffic scenario simulator with EV charging demand models. The results show that the proposed RL-based SurCharge system delivers a 10%–24% higher revenue margin than other competitive dynamic pricing baselines, without making unrealistic assumptions of prior models and data. Early adopters of electric vehicles (EVs) typically had Peak Demand Management private charging infrastructure in their garages [1]. The need for efficiency in EVSE particularly comes to the With the increase in EV owners residing in multiunit fore during times of peak demand.

In order to meet the demand for fast charging of the connection of EVs greatly increases the load on the power electric vehicles, these vehicles are often equipped with grid.

The access of EVs increases power grid.

While straightforward, Coulomb counting is susceptible to reliance on finite fossil fuels, has accelerated the demand for efficient accumulating errors and may not perform well under changing energy storage solutions. Batteries, pivotal in enabling clean energy conditions [2]. Surveying battery state estimation methods based adoption and powering electric vehicles (EVs), necessitate robust on ML approaches are discussed in [3]. It compares these methods Battery Management Systems (BMSs) for optimal performance and based on data quality, inputs/outputs, test conditions, battery types, longevity. A critical function of BMSs is the accurate estimation of and stated accuracy. This provides an overview of the ML State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH), which measures landscape for estimating SoC and SoH. Accurate estimation of SoC the remaining energy in a battery relative to its full capacity. This is crucial for safe operation of Li-ion battery packs, widely paper explores advanced methodologies, including machine employed in EVs, hybrid EVs, drones, and smart grids. In [4], [5] learning (ML) techniques, for enhancing SoC estimation accuracy a novel method uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long in lithium-ion batteries. The study evaluates several ML models— Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for precise SOC estimation in Li-ion Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Feedforward Neural batteries is proposed.

This paper compares the applications of four commonly used machine learning methods (decision tree, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and neural network) in lithium-ion battery modeling. The adaptability on working condition, temperature and degradation of above four modeling methods are analysed in detail. Results show that neural network performs best when working condition changes. All the models basically have the same performance on adaptability to temperature. The battery dynamic characteristics change significantly in the aging process and it is necessary to include battery test data under different degradation levels into training sets as to obtain a model that can predict the voltage response accurately in various aging states.",

Furthermore, these methods are usually is highly correlated with the driving range, reliability, and safety valid for systems having a small number of states. of the electric vehicles. Therefore, a controller of the thermal To achieve high performance while satisfying the system should be designed to minimize the tracking error and power consumption while satisfying constraints. In this study, a constraints without the worry about model accuracy, reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller is proposed. This reinforcement learning (RL) could be an answer. RL paper presents the selection of states and design of the reward automatically finds action that maximizes reward so we can function of RL for the thermal management system of EV. The expect better performance than the rule-based approaches. Also, controller is trained by the sequential learning method that is a plant model is not required for the RL approaches because they based on Deep Q-network (DQN) and adjusted for fast are developed to learn from the interaction data with the actual convergence of multi-input problems. The results show better environment. Furthermore, RL can handle constraints through performance compared with the rule-based controller. reward design and it can apply to a complex system having many system states.",

If too much power than driver’s demand hydrogen fuels as the main power source received much is provide to the moving vehicle, the limited stored energy will attention in recent years. Some scholars speculate the fuel decrease rapidly so that the energy might not be enough to cell hybrid electric vehicle will become the most popular reach the planned travel distance. However, if the practical green energy vehicles in the future [3]. With the energy/power supplied to the vehicle is limited, the rapid development of FCHEV, the energy management for performance of the moving vehicle will be degraded and it the vehicle performance, driving range and energy storage could also affect the driving experience. In this study, a has become extremely important. In [4], the authors reinforcement learning approach is utilized for the dynamic proposed an energy management structure of fuel cell/battery energy management of fuel cell and battery hybrid electric hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV), while in this study, a vehicles.

Battery life depends on the materials the batteries are made of, the design of the system, and the conditions under which it operates. All these factors make efficient battery power management a real challenge. Even so, to the growing understanding of how a battery degrades over time, due to the existence of new tools for modeling and providing a diagnosis, the idea of merging the knowledge that we have already with artificial intelligence, to create a digital \"twin\" of the battery.

As the arc current of series fault is such as arc current zero rest phenomenon, arc current period easily influenced by high-frequency noise in the charging system characteristics and time-frequency domain analysis. However, of electric vehicle, it is difficult for traditional fault identification there is no obvious periodicity of DC arc, the traditional AC methods in time-frequency domain to detect accurately. Machine arc detection method is not suitable for detecting DC arc. learning-based fault detection approaches can be trained by Therefore it is essential to study the features of DC arc[3].

By comparing and series arc fault mostly occurs at the junction box, high-voltage analyzing the characteristics of Goo-gleNet, AlexNet, VGG16 and bus interface and electrical equipment interface, which is the other common network models, the VGG16 network with most common arc fault in the electric vehicle charging relatively simple structure and high recognition accuracy is system[4]. Because of the high bus voltage in the charging selected to design the arc fault detection algorithm, and the arc system of electric vehicle, once the electrode gap appears, it current spectrum data is used to train and verify the arc fault will easily lead to the breakdown of the gap and turn into a identification algorithm.

When EVs participate in the demand response real-time scenarios with more uncertain factors. Generally, program,thechargingcostcanbesignificantlyreducedbytaking thereal-timecharging/dischargingcontrolstrategyconsidering full advantage of the real-time pricing signals. However, many stochastic factors exist in the dynamic environment, bringing uncertain electricity prices and users’ demand satisfaction significant challenges to design an optimal charging/discharging can be formulated as an optimization problem with a known control strategy. This paper develops an optimal EV charg- state transition. Then it can be solved by model-based ap- ing/discharging control strategy for different EV users under proaches like dynamic programming [9], model predictive dynamic environments to maximize EV users’ benefits. We first control (MPC) [10], model-based RL [11], etc. Nevertheless, formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then we consider EV users with different behaviors as agents it is tough to establish an accurate system model or estimate in different environments. Furthermore, a horizontal federated the state transition when considering various EV users’ inde- reinforcement learning (HFRL)-based method is proposed to terminate charging/discharging behaviors. fit various users’ behaviors and dynamic environments.

    "abstract": "The utilization of electrolyte additives has been regarded as an efficient strategy to construct dendrite-free aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the blurry screening criteria and time-consuming experimental tests inevitably restrict the application prospect of the electrolyte additive strategy. With the rise of artificial intelligence technology, machine learning (ML) provides an avenue to promote upgrading of energy storage devices. Herein, we proposed an intriguing ML-assisted method toaccelerate the development efficiency of electrolyte additives on dendrite-free AZIBs. Concretely, we selected the Gutmann donor number (DN value) as a screen parameter, which can reflect the interactionbetweensolventmoleculesandions,andproposedanintegrated ML model that can predict the DN values of organic molecules via molecular fingerprints, thereby achieving the screening of electrolyte additives. Then, combined with experimental tests and theoretical calculations, the influence law of three additive molecules with different DN values on the thermodynamic stability of the Zn anode and its corresponding optimization mechanisms were revealed; the DN values of the additives are in positive correlation with the electrochemical performance of the Zn anode. Especially, an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) additive with a high DN value (36) integrated with various Zn-based cells presentedasuperiorelectrochemicalperformance,includingahighcalendarlife(1500h),astableCoulombicefficiency(99% within 450 cycles), and a favorable cycling retention. This work pioneers ML techniques for predicting DN values for electrolyte additives, offering a compelling investigation method for the investigation of AZIBs.",

Any smart vehicle has dozens of these ECUs which not the need to protect their complicated and associated systems from only control the critical components, but also communicate with cyber threats which vital necessity. It is critical to ensure the safety each other to share necessary information and ensure smooth of an electric vehicle to prevent damage to human life or assets. functioning of the vehicle. Different protocols exist which Controller Area Network (CAN) is a message-broadcast protocol provide this communication channel between ECUs. Some of i.e., work on data link layer most deployed on EVs to facilitate them are Ethernet, FlexRay, MOST (Media Oriented Systems communication between different control components called Transport), CAN (Controller Area Network), and LIN (Local Electronic Control Units or ECUs. An ECU controls the Interconnection Network). A comprehensive comparative study functioning of different electronic or mechanical components and of these proto cols is given in [2]. This work focuses on CAN communicates with other ECUs on the network by sending since it is most prominently used by automobile manufacturers messages over CAN bus. Communication over CAN is unencrypted as an intra-vehicle communication network. CAN was and unauthenticated and thus prone to malicious attacks. This developed by Robert Bosch GmbH in 1986 as a serial bus work presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for electric message-broadcast system based on the CSMA-CD protocol vehicles.

Energy generated using is converted into DC by electric vehicle charging fossil fuels must be reduced as the emission of greenhouse equipment. To convert AC to DC the most commonly gases is more which leads to global warming. To achieve used circuit is a rectifier and the DC supply is given to sustainable development Electric Vehicles are introduced the load. The AC supply has a term called power factor which reduce carbon emissions compared to combustion and also relates to power loss. Power loss may happen engines. Nowadays, electric vehicles are growing faster, when the power factor is not unity. The power factor is especially in two two-wheeler segments. Most of the two- wheelers and a few four-wheelers are charged from defined as the phase angle between the AC voltage and household AC supply. The AC supply is generated from AC. If any phase difference is present then the power power plants like thermal, hydropower plants, etc., which factor will not be unity and power loss occur. Ultimately also use some kind of fossil fuels and emit carbon which the power is generated to supply the load. The load may affects the environment. An EV is powered by a battery pack be resistive inductive or capacitive or can be a and the battery pack is a DC source. So, the AC is converted combination of all. If the load is a resistive type, then to DC and given to a variable load battery pack. As the load there is no effect on the power factor but if any voltage changes with respect to time, the power factor of the inductive or capacitive load is present on the load side input AC supply cannot be maintained in unity. Power factor then the power factor is affected. The power factor plays a critical role in power transmission. Power loss happens as the power factor is not unity. To maintain the change is due to the charge and discharge characteristics power factor unity the duty cycle of the boost converter is of the inductor and capacitor. The battery pack of an EV changed based on the input AC voltage, current, rectified DC is made of several cells connected in series and parallel. voltage, and output voltage from the boost converter. Due to Each cell can be represented as a capacitive load. In EV, the reduction in power loss while transmission and a capacitor means a battery pack is charged by DC conversion the battery pack is charged faster with respect to which is converted from an AC source which leads to a time. power factor disturbance due to its characteristics. This leads to power loss and there are many powers",

    "abstract": "Alternative fuels are becoming more popular as awareness of fossil fuel depletion, pollution, and climate change grows. Numerous industrial companies are producing electric automobiles for use worldwide. Electric vehicles’ battery packs’ cooling causes firing due to high temperatures. In this study, the surface temperatures of a single electric battery with dimensionsof160mm3210mmwithinabatterypackwereinvestigatedusingcomputationalfluiddynamicsand,subse- quently, Levenberg-Marquardt machine learning as a function of ambient temperature, convective heat transfer coeffi- cient, nominal capacity of the electric battery, and discharge rate. The transport coefficient has been calculated for a rechargeableelectricbatterywithanominalcapacityrangingfrom14.6to20Ahandadischargeratevaryingbetween1 and15,takingintoaccountconditionsofstagnantairattemperaturesrangingfrom20(cid:3)Cto35(cid:3)Candvaluesbetween5 and 20W/m2.K. Insufficient or absent cooling of battery temperatures can lead to them reaching combustion tempera- turesofelectricvehiclebatteries,typicallyfrom50(cid:3)Cto80(cid:3)C,dependingontheoperationalcircumstances.Anartificial neuralnetworkwasutilizedinmachinelearningtoforecastmaximumtemperaturesbasedonoperatingconditionswith- out requiring simulation. The neural network achieved an estimated mean squared error of 0.00552 and a calculated coefficient of determination of 0.99. The neural network model can predict outputs with mean and standard deviation rates below 0.237. The anticipated artificial neural network model can accurately forecast the maximum surface tem- peratureofanelectricvehiclebattery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract—On the whole, the number of electric vehicles(EVs) Primary Side Secondary Side Lf has been rising quickly worldwide. Meeting the high- performance power-conversion demands to facilitate a more sustainable future requires isolated DC/DC converters like: phase shifted full bridge (PSFB) DC/DC converter. This article presents the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based inductor current monitoring and anomaly detection in a pulse- Lm n:1 Co width modulation (PWM) controlled phase shifted 3-level PSFB converter to be adopted for fast EV charger applications. A Input DC novel model has been proposed with a new chronological long short-term memory (LSTM) based autoencoder (AE) or LSTM- S2 S4 D2 D4 AE model which results in detection and diagnosis of such anomalies. MATLAB/Simulink is utilized for the validation of fast charging analysis and in the anomaly identification methodology, Python has been used as a programming",

This article uses machine learning to accurate battery life predictions can help manufacturers and predict battery performance early, based on factors like operators plan for replacements, avoid costly failures, and temperature, voltage, and current during initial charge- ensure vehicle reliability [12-14]. Similarly, in energy storage discharge cycles. Mechanisms such as Gradient Boosting, systems for smart grids, predicting battery degradation can Random Forest, SVM, as well as Neural Networks, are optimize maintenance schedules, improve grid stability, and tested with historical battery data to find patterns of reduce operational costs. degradation. The study also explores how well these models work for different types of batteries. II. RELATED WORKS Research in battery life cycle prediction using machine",
