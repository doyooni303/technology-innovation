As more battery systems methods wrong results. It is crucial to mitigate the advanced require network connectivity for intelligent health monitoring, cyberattacks in the battery health monitoring systems. cyberattacks become a serious threat. A notable attack is an adversarial attack that generates stealthier input data Currently, a common mitigation strategy for adversarial misleading the ML results.

    "title": "Autonomous PEV charging scheduling using Dyna-Q reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a demand response method to reduce the long-term charging cost of single plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) while overcoming obstacles such as the stochastic nature of the user's driving behaviour, traffic condition, energy usage, and energy price. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an unknown transition probability matrix and solved using deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed method does not require any initial data on the PEV driver's behaviour and shows improvement on learning speed when compared to a pure model-free reinforcement learning method. A combination of model- based and model-free learning methods called Dyna-Q reinforcement learning is utilized in our strategy. Every time a real experience is obtained, the model is updated, and the RL agent will learn from both the real experience and “imagined” experiences from the model. Due to the vast amount of state space, a table-lookup method is impractical, and a value approximation method using deep neural networks is employed for estimating the long-term expected reward of all state-action pairs.

    "input_text": "Title: Autonomous PEV charging scheduling using Dyna-Q reinforcement learning Abstract: This paper proposes a demand response method to reduce the long-term charging cost of single plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) while overcoming obstacles such as the stochastic nature of the user s driving behaviour, traffic condition, energy usage, and energy price. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an unknown transition probability matrix and solved using deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed method does not require any initial data on the PEV driver s behaviour and shows improvement on learning speed when compared to a pure model-free reinforcement learning method. A combination of model- based and model-free learning methods called Dyna-Q reinforcement learning is utilized in our strategy. Every time a real experience is obtained, the model is updated, and the RL agent will learn from both the real experience and imagined experiences from the model.

If the load is a resistive type, then to DC and given to a variable load battery pack. As the load there is no effect on the power factor but if any voltage changes with respect to time, the power factor of the inductive or capacitive load is present on the load side input AC supply cannot be maintained in unity. Power factor then the power factor is affected. The power factor plays a critical role in power transmission. Power loss happens as the power factor is not unity. To maintain the change is due to the charge and discharge characteristics power factor unity the duty cycle of the boost converter is of the inductor and capacitor. The battery pack of an EV changed based on the input AC voltage, current, rectified DC is made of several cells connected in series and parallel. voltage, and output voltage from the boost converter. Due to Each cell can be represented as a capacitive load. In EV, the reduction in power loss while transmission and a capacitor means a battery pack is charged by DC conversion the battery pack is charged faster with respect to which is converted from an AC source which leads to a time. power factor disturbance due to its characteristics. This leads to power loss and there are many powers",
