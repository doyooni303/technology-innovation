In power system, the energy which is fed to the grid control and management is accomplished using various architectures system. The variation in the control and manage systems are based on the performance and features as well as the overall cost. HEVs were really high increased air and oil emissions control. HEVs of different designs are becoming increasingly common, as they can achieve high fuel savings and mitigate emissions through multiple storage systems. The most powerful approach is the battery-driven vehicles.This article examines the management of energy issue with the minimisation of the operating costs of the HEVs for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).

The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an unknown transition probability matrix and solved using deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed method does not require any initial data on the PEV driver's behaviour and shows improvement on learning speed when compared to a pure model-free reinforcement learning method. A combination of model- based and model-free learning methods called Dyna-Q reinforcement learning is utilized in our strategy. Every time a real experience is obtained, the model is updated, and the RL agent will learn from both the real experience and “imagined” experiences from the model. Due to the vast amount of state space, a table-lookup method is impractical, and a value approximation method using deep neural networks is employed for estimating the long-term expected reward of all state-action pairs. An average of historical price and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network are used to predict future price. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and its ability to reach an optimal policy quicker while avoiding state of charge (SOC) depletion during trips when compared to existing PEV charging schemes.",bibtex; pdf,34,2,34,True

Behind the performance, safety, and reliability of EV stands the Battery Management System (BMS) that optimizes battery performance through monitoring, management, and protection of the battery pack. Traditional BMS designs have rule-based or model-based approaches with static parameters, which are not sufficiently adaptive to deal with real usage patterns and battery aging effects. The presented paper proposes a scheme of adaptive control based on AI for BMS utilizing the ML and DL algorithms to enhance system robustness, extend the life of the battery, and optimize charging/discharge operations. The proposed system utilizes neural networks and reinforcement algorithms to estimate dynamic state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), and temperature control against varying loads and ambient conditions. We compare the operation of our framework with traditional BMS controllers through HIL tests and simulation. Our findings indicate that AI-based BMS delivers more accurate predictions, fault tolerance, better energy efficiency and battery life improvements. This paper presents a critical survey of common AI use cases employed in BMS, proposes a novel hybrid AI architecture for adaptive real- time control, and proposes deployment strategies that can be deployed on the latest EV platforms.

Through a comprehensive analysis of extensive experimental data with various machine-learning methods, we report herein quantitative correlations between the structural features of carbon electrodes and the in-operando behavior of EDLCs including energy and power density.

Garage-orphaned MURB residents have to mostly rely on public chargers, which currently handle only 5% of the EV charging needs. With EVs becoming more mainstream, public chargers will not be able to match the operations scale without additional deployments. This will not only lead to a demand–supply mismatch in the short term but also impact the growth of EV adoption in the long term. For man- aging the demand–supply mismatch, dynamic pricing is a widely used control tool, but it is often difficult to make in- formed pricing decisions when 1) there is variability (both) in demand and supply, 2) users’ spatiotemporal behavior and price elasticity are unknown, and 3) charging preconditions (such as the state of charge) are not freely available. In this article, we present SurCharge, which uses reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these challenges in dy- namic pricing for EV charging. Our approach is evaluated on real-world traffic patterns for Luxembourg by augment- ing the Luxembourg Simulation of Urban Mobility traffic scenario simulator with EV charging demand models. The results show that the proposed RL-based SurCharge system delivers a 10%–24% higher revenue margin than other competitive dynamic pricing baselines, without making unrealistic assumptions of prior models and data.

However, the blurry screening criteria and time-consuming experimental tests inevitably restrict the application prospect of the electrolyte additive strategy. With the rise of artificial intelligence technology, machine learning (ML) provides an avenue to promote upgrading of energy storage devices. Herein, we proposed an intriguing ML-assisted method toaccelerate the development efficiency of electrolyte additives on dendrite-free AZIBs. Concretely, we selected the Gutmann donor number (DN value) as a screen parameter, which can reflect the interactionbetweensolventmoleculesandions,andproposedanintegrated ML model that can predict the DN values of organic molecules via molecular fingerprints, thereby achieving the screening of electrolyte additives. Then, combined with experimental tests and theoretical calculations, the influence law of three additive molecules with different DN values on the thermodynamic stability of the Zn anode and its corresponding optimization mechanisms were revealed; the DN values of the additives are in positive correlation with the electrochemical performance of the Zn anode. Especially, an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) additive with a high DN value (36) integrated with various Zn-based cells presentedasuperiorelectrochemicalperformance,includingahighcalendarlife(1500h),astableCoulombicefficiency(99% within 450 cycles), and a favorable cycling retention.
